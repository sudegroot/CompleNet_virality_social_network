# CompleNet_virality_social_network 
This repository consists all the code used for the manuscript 'The Impact of Crisis Events on Predicting Social Media Virality', submitted to the 14th Annual Conference on Complex Networks. The folder 'Scrape&Prepare data' consists of all the code used to scrape the data and make the appropriate train/test splits (the train and validation sets are later combined for cross-validation). The folder 'Modeling&Figures' contains all code used for model training, model testing, and making figures.

The data used for this thesis can be found in the 'Data' folder. Due to Twitter regulations, the data only consists of the tweet ids of the tweets relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that are scraped for this study. Be aware that the number of tweet ids can differ from the number of tweets mentioned in the paper. This is because only tweets of which user features were available are used. The tweets and corresponding user features can be rehydrated using the Twitter API. However, it could be that some tweets or users might be deleted or put on private and are therefore no longer available. Moreover, user and tweet features might change over time.
